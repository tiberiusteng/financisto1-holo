Please see https://github.com/dsolonenko/financisto for latest development by 
orginal author.

This codebase is started from an imported copy of an old version of source code 
at launchpad https://code.launchpad.net/~financisto-dev/financisto/trunk, as 
an working interim version until proper version 2 comes out.

I haven't changed the package name yet, so you'll need to remove the Play Store version,
to be able to install this version.

BE SURE TO BACK UP YOUR DATA!

* Holo theme
* Fixed date/time picker
* Improved text layout, support for device text scaling
* Search memo text
* Location removed due to major change in Google Maps API
* Backup file compatible with Play Store version 1.7.1
* Dropbox sync works, but you need to provide your own appid/key
